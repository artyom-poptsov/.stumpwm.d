* avp's StumpWM Configuration
  My [[https://stumpwm.github.io][StumpWM]] configuration.
** Key bindings
   As an active [[http://awesome.naquadah.org/][Awesome]] TWM user I struggle to have similar
   keybindings for StumpWM to make simultaneous use of two different
   WMs easier.

   | Keybinding | Action                                    |
   |------------+-------------------------------------------|
   | s-f        | Switch current window to fullscreen mode. |
   | s-j        | Switch to the next window.                |

   | C-s-l      | Lock the screen.                          |
   | s-d        | Open dmenu.                               |
   | s-1..8     | Go to the Nth group.                      |
   | s-!        | Move current window to the 1st group.     |
   | s-@        | .. to the 2nd group.                      |
   | s-#        | .. to the 3rd group.                      |
